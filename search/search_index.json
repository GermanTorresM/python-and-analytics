There are many options when working with the data using pandas. The following list shows some of the things that can be done using pandas. Cleaning data by removing or replacing missing values Converting data formats Sorting rows Deleting or adding rows and columns Merging or joining DataFrames Summarizing data by pivoting or reshaping Creating visualizations This list is far from complete.
